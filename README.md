Instruction based game

This is a project I was working on. It's an instruction based game where you have to give it a set of instructions(forward, turn left and/or turn right). The theme is space.

How to play(ingame not on your keyboard):

movement: click on the arrow up key to give it instruction to move forward, 
          click on the arrow turning left to give it instruction to turn left, 
          click on the arrow turning right to give it instruction to turn right.

weapons: click on the missile for heavy plasma cannon,
         click on the minigun for automatic plasma gun.

If you wish to remove an instruction, click on the " X " key to delete the previous instruction

After you've given it a set of instructions click on the cog(bottom right corner) to execute the instructions in order.



***The goal of this project was to learn how to move an object based on set of recorded instructions executed in order.***
